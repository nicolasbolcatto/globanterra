# globanterraWebsite

# Project description

This is my first site as a web developer. It’s a website for drone aerial mapping, land surveying, GIS, and remote sensing startup that I personally manage. The startup’s name is GlobanTerra.

The aim is to build a basic website still without Javascript code for interaction behind the scenes.
The main goal of the project is to create my first website to complete the Web Development course at [Coderhouse](https://www.coderhouse.com/).

# Tech Stack

The following languages, platforms and technologies are included in the project:

- Plain HTML and CSS
- CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid
- Responsive Design using media queries
- Animations and transitions using CSS and AOS (https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) library
- Git and GitHub for version control
- Bootstrap 5
- SCSS
- SEO Optimization
- 404 Error Page
- Form functionality with Formspree

# Functionality

The website allows visitors to read about GlobanTerra’s services, watch videos where previous experience and completed works are shown,
and get to know the members of the team.

As stated earlier, GlobanTerra’s website does not include Javascript functionality so far.
Nevertheless, it includes a contact form that is functional with the use of Formspree, allowing to create a database of potential clients. It will be given functionality with JS soon.
